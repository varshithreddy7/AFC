# AFC Restaurant Website

Hey there! üëã This is the official website for AFC (Absolutely Fried Chicken) - a restaurant chain that's all about serving up some seriously good fried chicken.

## What's This All About?

Building a restaurant website isn't just about putting up some photos and calling it a day. We wanted to create something that actually makes people hungry and helps them find what they're looking for quickly. Here's what we've packed into this project:

- A **Next.js 15** setup with all the latest bells and whistles
- **Mobile-first design** because let's be real, everyone's on their phones
- **Fast loading images** - nobody wants to wait for food photos to load
- **SEO that actually works** - we want people to find us on Google
- Some pretty sweet **animations** using Framer Motion and GSAP
- A **circular menu carousel** that's honestly kind of addictive to play with

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd AFC-FRONTEND/AFC/afc

# Install everything
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

That's it! Head to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the magic happen.

## Project Layout

Here's how we've organized everything (because clean code matters):

```

## Design Choices

We went with a **golden yellow** (`#ebbd28`) as the primary color - it just screams "delicious fried chicken," doesn't it? Combined with clean blacks and whites, it gives that premium fast-food vibe.

For fonts, we're using **Geist Sans** and **Geist Mono** - they're clean, readable, and have that modern feel.

The animations are subtle but effective. We didn't want to go overboard, just enough to make interactions feel smooth and engaging.

## Performance Stuff

We've put some effort into making this thing fast:

- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component (WebP/AVIF formats)
- **Automatic code splitting** so you only load what you need
- **Proper caching headers** for static assets
- **SEO meta tags** for better search visibility
- **Security headers** because safety first

## Tech Stack

Here's what we're working with:

- **Next.js 15** with the new App Router (because it's awesome)
- **React 19** for the UI magic
- **TypeScript** for fewer bugs and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (utility classes FTW)
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **GSAP** for the more complex animations
- **Keen Slider** for carousels and sliders

## Deployment

We're hosted on **Vercel** (because it just works with Next.js):
- Automatic deployments from main branch
- Built-in CDN for fast global delivery
- SSL certificates handled automatically
- Performance monitoring out of the box

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Check for linting issues
npm run lint:fix     # Fix linting issues automatically
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript types
```
